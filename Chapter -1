allowance is 40% of basic salary, and house rent allowance is 20% of
basic salary. Write a program to calculate his gross salary

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int salary, dearness_allowance,house_rent_allowance,gross;
    printf("Enter a salary: ");
    scanf("%d",&salary);
    dearness_allowance = ((0.4)*salary);
    printf("Dearness Allownace: %d\n",dearness_allowance);
    house_rent_allowance =((0.2)*salary);
    printf("House Rent Allownace: %d\n",house_rent_allowance);
    gross = salary +  dearness_allowance + house_rent_allowance;
    printf("Gross Salary: %d",gross*12);
}


2 .The distance been two cities (in km.) is input through the
keyboard. Write a program to convert and print this distance in
meters, feet, inches and centimeters.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int distance;
    float in_meters, in_feet, in_inches, in_centimeters;
    printf("Enter the distance: ");
    scanf("%d",&distance);
    in_meters = distance * 1000;
    printf("In Meters: %.2f\n",in_meters);
    in_feet = distance * 3280.84;
    printf("In Feet: %.2f\n",in_feet);
    in_inches = distance * 39370.1;
    printf("In Inches: %.2f\n",in_inches);
    in_centimeters = distance * 100000;
    printf("In Centimeter: %.2f\n",in_centimeters);
 }

3 .If the marks obtained by a student in five different subjects are
input through the keyboard, write a program to find out the
aggregate marks and percentage marks obtained by the student.
Assume that the maximum marks that can be obtained by a student
in each subject is 100.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int mark1, mark2, mark3, mark4, mark5,total;
    float percentage;
    printf("Enter mark 1: ");
    scanf("%d",&mark1);
    printf("Enter mark 2: ");
    scanf("%d",&mark2);
    printf("Enter mark 3: ");
    scanf("%d",&mark3);
    printf("Enter mark 4: ");
    scanf("%d",&mark4);
    printf("Enter mark 5: ");
    scanf("%d",&mark5);
    total  = mark1+mark2+mark3+mark4+mark5;
    percentage = ((total/500)*100);
    printf("Total Marks: %d\n",total);
    printf("Percentage: %f",percentage);
}
4 .Temperature of a city in Fahrenheit degrees is input through the
keyboard. Write a program to convert this temperature into
Centigrade degrees.


#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int fareheit;
    float celcius;
    printf("Enter a farenheit: ");
    scanf("%d",&fareheit);
    celcius = (fareheit -32)*.5556;
    printf("Celcuis: %.2f",celcius);
}
5 .The length and breadth of a rectangle and radius of a circle are
input through the keyboard. Write a program to calculate the area
and perimeter of the rectangle, and the area and circumference of
the circle.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int length,breadth;
    float radius, area_of_rectangle,perimeter_of_rectangle,area_of_circle,circumference_of_circle;
    printf("Enter length of rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d",&length);
    printf("Enter breadth of rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d",&breadth);
    printf("Enter radius of circle: ");
    scanf("%f",&radius);
    area_of_rectangle = length * breadth;
    printf("Area of Rectangle: %.2f\n",area_of_rectangle);
    perimeter_of_rectangle = 2*(length + breadth);
    printf("Perimeter of Rectangle: %.2f\n",perimeter_of_rectangle);
    area_of_circle = 3.14 * (radius * radius);
    printf("Area Of Circle: %.2f\n",area_of_circle);
    circumference_of_circle = 2* 3.14* radius;
    printf("Circumference Of Circle: %.2f\n",circumference_of_circle);
}
6 .Paper of size A0 has dimensions 1189 mm x 841 mm. Each
subsequent size A(n) is defined as A(n-1) cut in half parallel to its
shorter sides. Thus paper of size A1 would have dimensions 841
mm x 594 mm. Write a program to calculate and print paper sizes
A0, A1, A2, … A8.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r;
    a = 1189;
    b = 841;
    printf("A0: %d X %d\n",a,b);
    c = b;
    d = a/2;
    printf("A1: %d X %d\n",c,d);
    e = d;
    f = c/2;
    printf("A2: %d X %d\n",e,f);
    g = f;
    h = e/2;
    printf("A3: %d X %d\n",g,h);
    i = h;
    j = g/2;
    printf("A4: %d X %d\n",i,j);
    k = j;
    l = h/2;
    printf("A5: %d X %d\n",k,l);
    m = l;
    n = k/2;
    printf("A6: %d X %d\n",m,n);
    o = n;
    p = m/2;
    printf("A7: %d X %d\n",o,p);
    q = p;
    r = o/2;
    printf("A8: %d X %d\n",q,r);
    
}
